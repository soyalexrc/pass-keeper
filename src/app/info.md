Do create an NgModule in the app’s root folder, for example, in /src/app.

In Angular, everything is organized in modules, and every application have at least one of them, the app root module. The app module is the entry point of the application, and is the module that Angular uses to bootstrap the application. The setup instructions when creating a new application produces a minimal AppModule with a single component. You’ll evolve this module as the application grows.
