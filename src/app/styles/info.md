In a similar way to how we want to avoid bloating up the AppModule as the application grows, itâ€™s also true for the styles.scss file.You should instead create a styles folder, which contains mixins or css-functions, responsible for their own areas. These files are then imported in the appropriate order inside the styles.scss file, providing their global styles to the rest of the app. Create mixins for reusable css-snippets, and scope the associated logic together.
